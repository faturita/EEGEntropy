Although recently impressive advances in neuroimagining techniques has pushed EEG, Electroencephalography technology a little bit out of the way in clinical context, where it has always being used since its discovery by Berger.

Their versatility, ease of use, temporal resolution, ease and development of fabrication, and the explosion as a consumer devices, is pushing EEG devices to become the de facto non invasive method to access and harness brain information.

Key contribution to this development has been the field of Brain Computer Interfaces, which is the development of a new channel of communication particularly aimed to person with some degree of neuro degenerative disease.

One very remarkable aspect of this communication channel is the ability to transmit some general cognitive state, like alertness, drowsiness, boredom, and so on, which can very helpful particularly in rehabilitation procedures. \citep{Guger2009a}.

One of the most shocking reasons is that we can use the capacity of ML techniques to automatically explore the signal, by using these new features.

Additionally, they have a high variability between different subjects and even between different moments for the same subject.  This inherent complexity comes from  is a real challenge when it is required to extract information from raw EEG signals.

Signal is complex and it is difficult to find those values which are not variable.

Due to this inner complexity, it is often necessary to implement many distinct and specialized algorithmic methods, to filter the signal, classify it, and try to determine some meaning out of it.  

In this work EEG signals from ALS patients are offline processed with this radically different and horizontal approach.  This is the continuation of the work presented here and here \citep{Ramele2016}, which was previously applied to rythmic patterns.

The same methodological algorithm can be used to process rhythmic EEG markers or paradigms and at the same time to analyze spatiotemporal phenomena like ERP, particularly P300 \citep{Ramele2016}.

This method is based on a morphological analysis of the shape of the EEG signal.

Successful applications of BCI has been applied to rehabilitation \citep{Jure2016}.

This paper reports on a study done to address
the hypothesis that communication task complexity
(copy-spelling vs. novel text generation of a picture
description) is correlated with BCI performance accuracy
and P300 characteristics.


BCI accuracy
was calculated as the percentage of attempted selections
that matched the intended selection.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Besides new novel applications of BCI, the core value of the entire discipline is to provide communication assistance to patients.  It is understood that people suffering from ALS, even though the disease do not harm the CNS, their brain signals and suffer slow and deterioriating changes that lead to more complex patterns to be detected [cite]

Although they are used (PAPER DE P300 donde dice que se usa en los laboratorios) they still lack the bla bla bla CITE LOTTE BOOK \citep{Huggins2016}

We use the dataset 008-2014 published on the BNCI-Horizon website.  This consortium of companies and universities were developed under the umbrella of the EU to define, provide guidance for BCI development \citep{Riccio2013}.

\subsection{Experimental protocol}

The protocol is explained [HERE] but can be summarized as follows:  8 subjects affected by different levels of ALS disease, were used to generate all the data. The P300 task was meant to spell 7 words of 5 letter each.  The first 3 runs were used for training and the remaining 4 for testing with visual feedback.  A trial, for this experiment, was defined as each attempt to select a letter from the speller, and it was composed of 10 repetions of flashes of 6 rows and 6 columns of the matrix, yielding 120 repetitions.  Flashing of row/columns was performed for 0.125 s, following by a resting period of the same size.

This dataset was recorded from a healthy subject during a no-feedback session. She/he sat in a normal chair with relaxed arms resting on the table and fingers in the standard typing position at the computer keyboard. The task was to press with the index and little fingers the corresponding keys in a self-chosen order and timing 'self-paced key typing'. The experiment consisted of 3 sessions of 6 minutes each. All sessions were conducted on the same day with some minutes break in-between. Typing was done at an average speed of 1 key per second.  

\subsection{Morphological Signal Analysis}

Due to the inner complexity of EEG signals, several approaches and methods has been applied to decode them.  Of particular interests are morphological signal analysis

\subsubsection{P300}

Uhhhh I can talk a lot about P300 \citep{Knuth2006}.

P300 single trial is a golden grail of Brain computer interfaces.  It is studied and analyzed in this way, here in this other way, in this other way is here.

\subsection{Algorithm}

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Signal to Image Transformation}

There are many ways an EEG matrix can be transformed into an image.

What we do is take the signal and plot it.  Thats all folks.

\subsubsection{Signal Averaging}

The methods for averaging.

\subsubsection{Classification}

Finally the classification is carried out by using the NBNN algorithm which can be described as follows.

BCI Simulation vs k-fold cross validation

\section{Results}

Results are shown in the following chart.

\end{figure}

Contrary to the literature (\citep{Huggins2016,Jure2016}) the best performing channels were not Cz and Pz and instead Pz.

it is quite likely that the data will be unbalanced (that is, an unequal number of trials in each condition)

The ITR, or BTR, in the case of reactive BCIs (CITE WOLPAW) strongly depends on the amount of averaging required to transmit a valid and robust selection.  If the amount of repetitions is reduced for each subject, performing a BCI Simulation can be shown on Fig. \ref{fig:singletrial}

\section{Discussion}

This method, different from other methods which is based on the nonlinearity of the gradient of histograms which can be used to detect 

is also based on how the image look like.

Results of one against the other

SNR of p300 and how to detect it

Check if you can use this to detect any kind of transient signbal


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}

With this result we showed a method to process EEG signals where the main characteristic can be both, rhytmic in nature as in motor imagery, and also transient and in time space, like the P300 event related potential.

If we avoid removing artefacts achieve a higher value of classification.

Si el desempeño da parecido hay que escribirlo ya que con menos valores se permite un ITR mayor.

We also achieved single trial classification for just one subject.
