abstract = {We present a novel approach to describe a P300 by a shape-feature vector, which offers several advantages over the feature vector used by the BCI2000 system. Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 . Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.},

abstract = {An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N=81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%} (N=38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a case study report about the applicability of thermography and algometry by pressure in the evaluation of lactation which causes breast engorgement. The case study was conducted in the Human Milk Bank of the “Universidade Federal do Paran{\'{a}} Hospital” in Curitiba, Paran{\'{a}} - Brazil. We selected two women (who were breastfeeding), one without and one with breast engorgement. Then, we compare the different patterns of engorgement, temperature and tolerance to painful pressure before and after treatment, which consisted of massage and manual milking. Initial measurements indicated that normal puerperal breasts were cooler than ingurgitated breasts; also it was found that the normal breasts were more tolerant to pain pressure. After treatment, the engorged breasts have their temperature reduced and also represented more tolerance to pain. The technologies applied, although with some limitations, have provided preliminary important information, which combined with the clinical examination showed different patterns of breast engorgement, temperature and tolerance to pain, comparing the events before and after treatment.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the support of attentional and memory processes in controlling a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Eight people with ALS performed two behavioral tasks: (i) a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, screening the temporal filtering capacity and the speed of the update of the attentive filter, and (ii) a change detection task, screening the memory capacity and the spatial filtering capacity. The participants were also asked to perform a P300-based BCI spelling task. By using correlation and regression analyses, we found that only the temporal filtering capacity in the RSVP task was a predictor of both the P300-based BCI accuracy and of the amplitude of the P300 elicited performing the BCI task. We concluded that the ability to keep the attentional filter active during the selection of a target influences performance in BCI control.},
